## 🔄 Migration Guide

### From 0.9.x to 1.0.x

#### Breaking Changes
- Authentication API endpoints have changed
- QR code parsing now requires explicit format specification
- Bulk operations require additional permissions

#### Migration Steps

1. **Update Authentication**
   ```typescript
   // Before (0.9.x)
   const response = await api.post('/login', credentials);

   // After (1.0.x)
   const response = await authService.loginWithPassphrase(credentials);
   ```

2. **Update QR Code Handling**
   ```typescript
   // Before (0.9.x)
   const qrData = parseQR(result);

   // After (1.0.x)
   const parsed = parseQRCode(result);
   if (parsed.isValid) {
     // Handle parsed data
   }
   ```

3. **Update Bulk Operations**
   ```typescript
   // Before (0.9.x)
   await api.post('/bulk-delete', { ids });

   // After (1.0.x)
   await credentialsService.bulkDelete(ids);
   ```
